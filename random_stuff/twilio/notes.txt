1. Build 'woodcliff_parsed_selected_columns_20191123' out of 'woodcliff_orig_20191111'
2. Combine Cell and Home Phones; Combine Email addresses in  'woodcliff_parsed_selected_columns_20191123' 
3. Load result in #2 to SQL Server @ [global-cp-digital].[dbo].[test_residents]
4. Exract undelivered messages from https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs and 'export to CSV'
5. In #4, '30006' Errors are landline or unreachable carrier. '30005' Erros are Unkonwn destination handset and '30003' is Unreachable destination handset.
6. Clean exported CSV in #4 and upload it to SQL Server @ [global-cp-digital].[dbo].[test_sms_log_20191123]
7. RUN this query to remove '-' from phone numbers:   UPDATE [dbo].[test_residents] SET [CellOrHomePhoneValues] = REPLACE([CellOrHomePhoneValues], '-', '')
8. RUN this query to extract only the lines with valid phone numbers:
SELECT [Unit]
	,[MoveInDate]
	,[ResidentName]
	,[CoResidentName]
	,[ROWN]
	,[HomePhone]
	,[WorkPhone]
	,[CellPhone]
	,[ROWNPhone]
	,[ISROWNSameAsHomeWorkOrCellPhone]
	,[CellOrHomePhoneFormula]
	,[CellOrHomePhoneValues]
	,b.[to]
	,[Email]
	,[Email2]
	,[EmailCombinedWithFormula]
	,[EmailCombinedValues]
	,[UnitAddress]
FROM [dbo].[test_residents] AS a
LEFT JOIN (
	SELECT DISTINCT [from]
		,[to]
		,[status]
	FROM [dbo].[test_sms_log_20191123]
	) AS b ON a.[CellOrHomePhoneValues] = b.[to]
WHERE b.[to] IS NULL -- where we did not fail to deliver messages
	--WHERE b.[to] is NOT NULL

9. Save the above query's result as 'residents_with_valid_numbers_20191123.csv' (I prefer xlsx because there are commas and semi colons in the raw data itself)
10. Run send_sms_reminders.py or send_emails.py using above Excel/CSV file as base.
