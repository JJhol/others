===================
There are three programs in this folder.
1. MultiThreadCharCounter.java	-	Runs multithreaded character counter
									and reports character count table
									as well as the time taken to run it
									at the end. Max. threads allowed is 64.

2. SimpleCharCounter.java	- 	Runs simple (one main() thread) character 
								counting. This is implemented to verify 
								the correctness of multi-thread program 
								above, and see if there's any significant
								time difference between simple vs. 
								multi-thread approaches.

3. CharCountTest.java	- 	Runs many iterations of character count programs
							(both multi-thread and simple approach) and
							reports average time taken. I simply became curious
							as to if multi-thread approach performs better
							on average over the simple approach [*].


There is also a folder named "/test" with ~100 text files of various size 
(generated with a quick python script) so that user can use them to test
run these programs above using those text files.

The procedure to compile and run the programs are fairly straightforward
and are detailed as comments at the top of each Java file.

[*] It takes about 0.05 sec on average to count characters in ~100 files 
inside the "/test" folder using simple approach. The average time drops
to about ~0.03 seconds when an additional thread was added. It also performs
slightly better (~0.04 secs) when running with two additional threads.
BUT beyond that, adding more threads simply doesn't do any better (i.e. 
the same as) than simple approach. I assume it's down to the IO time (probably
from disk read).

[**] The programs ignores "\n", "\t", "\r", " " (space) characters in counting
because they don't show up well when printing to stdout (terminal).

Thank you and please let me know if there's any issue running these.
