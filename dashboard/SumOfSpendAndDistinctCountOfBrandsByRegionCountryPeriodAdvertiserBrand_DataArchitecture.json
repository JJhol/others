hierarchy::: period => world => region => country => advertiser => brands


metrics I care about:::
=sum_of_spend_world, 
===sum_of_uniq_regions_in_world,
====sum_of_uniq_countries_in_world, 
=====sum_of_uniq_advertisers_in_world, 
==sum_of_uniq_brands_in_world

=sum_of_spend_in_each_region, 
====sum_of_uniq_countries_in_each_region, 
======sum_of_uniq_advertisers_in_each_region, 
==sum_of_uniq_brands_in_each_region

=sum_of_spend_in_each_country, 
=====sum_of_uniq_advertisers_in_each_country, 
==sum_of_uniq_brands_in_each_country

=sum_of_spend_in_each_advertiser, 
==sum_of_uniq_brands_in_each_advertiser

=sum_of_spend_in_brand


maybe we should define tree/forest this way:::
'Year': ['', 'Region', 'Country', 'Advertiser', 'Brand']
'Year': ['Region', 'Country', 'Advertiser', 'Brand']
'Year': ['Country', 'Advertiser', 'Brand']
-- if '' then replace with <hierarchy_name>+': ALL'

  
  { '2015': 
	[
		{ 
			name: 'World',
			value: [sum_of_spend_world, sum_of_uniq_countries_in_world, sum_of_uniq_advertisers_in_world, sum_of_uniq_brands_in_world]
			children: [
				{ 
					name: 'Region1',
					value: [sum_of_spend_in_region, sum_of_uniq_countries_in_region, sum_of_uniq_advertisers_in_region, sum_of_uniq_brands_in_region]
