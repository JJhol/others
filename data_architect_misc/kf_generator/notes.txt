question about KF generation:

Q1: Do we have FOUR (as opposed to THREE shown in the documentation) to generate GEO and DEMO dimension files? No. We don't usually send these files for APAC
What about Network and Daypart? Has data for ALL countries
ONLY CREAtive will have APAC data dimension file as well.

Q2: 
MED_KF_XXX[CC]_MM_YYYY.csv
XXX = Country Key

What is "Country Key"? Does that mean we produce MANY files at once? E.g., We are to generate Mexico, what are the files produced in the KF file set?
Also, what about "MM"? Is that representative of the MAX date in the data or is that more about the day KF file was generated? => current month

Q3: what if we generate everything for each region? (because it's going to be very big)

Q33: 
  SELECT [Geography Dim]
	,[Product Dim]
	,[Media Dim]
	,[Demographic Dim]
	,[Creative Dim]
	,[Daypart Dim]
	,[Network Dim]
	,[Month/Year] [Month Year]
	,[Country]
	,[Local Currency]
	,REPLACE(FORMAT([Spend Local], 'N', 'en-us'), ',', '') [Spend Local]
	,[Spend USD]
	,REPLACE(FORMAT([TRP], 'N', 'en-us'), ',', '') [TRP]
	,REPLACE(FORMAT([Normalized TRP], 'N', 'en-us'), ',', '') [Normalized TRP]	# the values must NOT have commas
	,[Insertions]
	,REPLACE(FORMAT([Impressions], 'N', 'en-us'), ',', '') [Impressions]
FROM [dbo].[MED_KF_HK]

why do we do replace and converting to 'N', 'en-us'?


Q4: What is the process to generate KF files?

Ask CBS: [Country] vs [Country ID] = We might want to coordinate wityh CBS to leave this column name the same for all the regions; 
to see if we can deliver in TSV format (having commas can mess up QA sometimes); "","",""
Ask CBS if we can deliver just ONE file for each dimension for the whole world; 


Day1:
python generate_kf.py HK -t y (will transfer to FTP)
python generate_kf.py HK -t n (will NOT transfer to FTP)
==> 

Day2:
python generate_kf.py Col Mx USD
==> 9 dimension files; 3 fact files; == 12 files total + MED_BRAND_MANUF_NA.csv; MED_MARKET_SUBCAT_NA.csv









1. Relationship between Hub and Country;   FROM [DM_1219_ColgateGlobal].[dbo].[CP_DIM_COUNTRY]



i guess right now someone has to copy the dump the data files to FTP?
what is the QA after generating these files? I heard they load them in staging?

For generating "MED_MEDIA_DM.csv", I think we use a different query than the following given in Edgar's doc?
SELECT [Media Dim], [Media Dim Text], [Dim Type], [Dim Type Text], [Media lvl 1], [Media lvl 1 text], 
	[Media lvl 2], [Media lvl 2 text], [Media lvl 3], [Media lvl 3 text], [Spot Length], [Spot  Bucket Length] 
FROM [dbo].[V_MED_MEDIA_DM]

For LATAM, NA and so on (not APAC):
[dbo].[CP_DIM_COUNTRY] and [dbo].COUNTRY_MASTER have configs like hubs and stuff
